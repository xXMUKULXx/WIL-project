## Welcome to CarCare Solutions Prototype Project!

Thank you for exploring our CarCare Solutions Prototype Project. At CarCare Solutions, we're dedicated to enhancing our ride pricing strategies, and this prototype represents a step forward in that direction. Below, you'll find an overview of the project, the datasets we're working with, and key steps taken.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of our Dynamic Pricing Prototype is to implement an intelligent pricing system for our transportation services. To achieve this, we're utilizing two essential datasets:

### 1. Dynamic Pricing Dataset

- **Link:** [Dynamic Pricing Case Study](https://statso.io/dynamic-pricing-case-study/)
- **Content:** This dataset provides comprehensive information about rides, customers, and service quality. Key features include the number of riders, loyalty statuses, past ride count, and more.

### 2. Data Preprocessing Dataset

- **Link:** [Stanford Cars Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eduardo4jesus/stanford-cars-dataset)
- **Content:** The Stanford Cars Dataset is employed for data preprocessing. It consists of images of cars, annotated with bounding boxes and class labels, making it valuable for fine-grained classification and object detection.

## Key Steps Taken

### 1. Data Preprocessing for Dynamic Pricing

- **Data Cleanup:**
  - Addressed missing values and outliers in the dynamic pricing dataset to ensure the reliability of our data.

- **Categorical Data Handling:**
  - Managed missing information in categorical features, ensuring a complete and accurate dataset.

- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Mapped categorical values to numerical equivalents, enhancing the compatibility of our data with machine learning models.

- **Machine Learning Model Preparation:**
  - Utilized a RandomForestRegressor model to prepare for dynamic pricing predictions.

- **Prediction Functionality:**
  - Demonstrated the model's ability to predict ride costs based on user input values.

### 2. Dynamic Pricing Prototype

- **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
  - Explored the dynamic pricing dataset to gain insights into its characteristics.

- **Visual Representation:**
  - Utilized visualizations to simplify complex relationships within the data.

- **Algorithm Implementation:**
  - Implemented a dynamic pricing algorithm, incorporating demand and supply adjustments.

- **Profitability Assessment:**
  - Evaluated the profitability of rides through visual representations.

## How to Get Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Copy the repository to your local machine:
